# My Portfolio  

I'm Joshua Bernstein, and this is my website porfolio GitHub! This README will go over basics of its architecture and technologies. This website was written from scratch by me, using Typescript React.

## Important Libraries
* [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/): Allows me to render 3D models and scenes.
* [React-Three-Fibre](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction): Has many helpful components for using ThreeJS in React.
* [React-Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/): Simple and highly-configurable animation.
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/): Highly styled and pretty components.
